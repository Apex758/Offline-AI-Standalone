Patterns can be recognized, extended and generalizations are formed using words and symbols based on observations.

For learners of grade one, patterning activities should involve opportunities for manipulating physical resources. This clearly allows them to extend, create patterns and make changes as they engage in the activities with a feeling of accomplishment. Moreover, the use of physical items creates a hands-on approach for students and encourages trial and error which is an important strategy in Mathematics. Patterns are observed in multiple areas; singing, writing, poetry, story-telling, the observed environment. Therefore, opportunities for developing the concept of patterns should be presented to students whereby their senses are stimulated and every learner has an opportunity to succeed through dance (body movements), singing, piecing physical materials together; ultimately catering to students at the concrete level so that full concept formation takes place."
