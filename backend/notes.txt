Here’s a clean, developer-friendly reorg you can paste into your project README / TODO.

## Run commands

### Start backend (dev)

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Setup embedded Python

```powershell
.\setup-embedded-python.bat
```

### Package backend (embedded build step)

```powershell
.\python-embed\python.exe build-scripts/package-backend.py
```

### Build release

```powershell
.\build-release.ps1
```   

"maximum" | "normal" | "store"        "compression": "store",   in package.json

## Product roadmap

### A) UX + editor flow

* Rich text editor **after generation** (post-processing step)
* Ensure editors match across modules (Quiz / Lesson Plan / Chat output editing)
* Add walkthrough / guided tour element
* Update tab names to match current content
* After login: create user profile fields (Name / “OAK” fields)

### B) Curriculum intelligence

* Better organize curriculum pages + build a “curriculum map” for AI ingestion
* Convert curriculum to vectors in **FAISS**
* Connect curriculum vectors to lesson planners (retrieval → planning)
* Connect AI Assistant to curriculum + planners (same retrieval layer)

### C) Model + prompting

* Create options for LLM (model picker + capability tiers)
* Apply LoRA patches (where relevant)
* FIX PROMPTS (centralize + version prompts; stop prompt drift)

### D) Reliability + settings

* Settings for updates (app update channel / model updates / content updates)
* Use API key for a “power model” when the user is online (local-first, cloud-boost)
* Read up on the email Ashley sent (capture requirements + decisions)

### E) Generation timing + performance signals

* Add timer: estimated completion time based on PC specs
* Ensure timing allocation is correct for **all** generators/streams
* Include marks/score fields for rubric generation

Add queue feature for generations

## Tuning guide (conversation memory window)

* Small model (~2GB): `max_turns = 2` (last 2 exchanges)
* Medium model (~4GB): `max_turns = 4`
* Large model (8GB+): `max_turns = 6`
