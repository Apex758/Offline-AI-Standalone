Begin by asking students to share examples of their favorite numbers or numbers that hold sentimental value.\n2. Write the numbers on the board and ask students to identify patterns and relationships between them.\n3. Introduce the concept of numbers to 10,000 and explain that we will be exploring this range today.\n4. State the learning objectives for the lesson: \"Analyze the concept of numbers to 10,000, evaluate the meaning of numbers to 10,000, and synthesize understanding by creating a visual representation of numbers to 10,000.\"\n\nDirect Instruction (20 minutes):\n\n1. Explain the concept of numbers to 10,000, using visual aids such as number lines and decimal charts.\n2. Use complex instructions with options for student choice to explore different representations of numbers to 10,000:\n\t* Option 1: Create a decimal chart to represent numbers to 10,000.\n\t* Option 2: Research online resources to find real-world examples of numbers to 10,000 (e.g., population sizes, temperature ranges).\n\t* Option 3: Design a visual representation of numbers to 10,000 using graph paper and colored pencils.\n3. Circulate around the room to provide support and answer questions.\n\nGuided Practice (20 minutes):\n\n1. Divide students into small groups and assign each group a different research topic related to numbers to 10,000 (e.g., population growth, temperature records, scientific notation).\n2. Ask each group to conduct independent research using online resources and present their findings to the class.\n3. Circulate around the room to facilitate discussion and provide feedback.\n\nIndependent Practice/Application (15 minutes):\n\n1. Provide students with a blank graph paper and ask them to create a visual representation of numbers to 10,000 using different scales and labels.\n2. Allow students to choose their own scale and design.\n3. Differentiation options:\n\t* For struggling students: Provide a pre-printed template with numbers to 10,000 and ask them to fill in the missing values.\n\t* For advanced students: Ask them to create a more complex visual representation, such as a 3D model or a graph with multiple scales.\n\nClosure (5-7 minutes):\n\n1. Review the key concepts learned during the lesson.\n2. Ask students to reflect on their visual representation and explain the meaning of numbers to 10,000.\n3. Distribute an exit ticket or formative assessment to check for understanding.\n\nAssessment:\n\n* Formative assessment strategies: Essays, presentations, self-assessment, peer review, tests\n* Success criteria:\n\t+ Analyzes the concept of numbers to 10,000.\n\t+ Evaluates the meaning of numbers to 10,000 through real-world applications.\n\t+ Creates a visual representation of numbers to 10,000 that accurately represents the concept.\n* Differentiation for various learning levels:\n\t+ For struggling students: Provide extra support and scaffolding during independent practice.\n\t+ For advanced students: Provide more complex research topics or ask them to create a more detailed visual representation.\n\nDifferentiation:\n\n* Support for struggling learners:\n\t+ Provide additional support during independent practice and offer one-on-one assistance.\n\t+ Use visual aids and manipulatives to help students understand complex concepts.\n* Extensions for advanced students:\n\t+ Provide more complex research topics or ask them to create a 3D model of a real-world application.\n\t+ Encourage them to create a more detailed visual representation that incorporates multiple scales.\n* Accommodations for special needs:\n\t+ Provide assistive technology for students with visual impairments.\n\t+ Use tactile aids and manipulatives for students with fine motor difficulties.\n\nReflection:\n\n* Teacher reflection prompts:\n\t+ What strategies were effective in engaging students and promoting understanding?\n\t+ How can I differentiate instruction to meet the needs of all learners?\n\t+ What adjustments can I make to the lesson plan for future implementations?\n* Modifications for next time:\n\t+ Consider incorporating more technology-based activities to engage students.\n\t+ Provide more opportunities for students to work in groups and share their findings.\n\n**Direct Instruction:**\n:\n\n1.
